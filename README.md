# Ghostbuster: Your GitHub Follower Auditor üëª

Tired of following people who don't follow you back on GitHub? **Ghostbuster** is here to help! This simple Go program audits your GitHub following list and unfollows those who haven't reciprocated the follow. Free up your feed and keep your network clean!

## ‚ú® Features

-   **Easy Setup:** Just a few steps to get started.
-   **Automated Unfollowing:** Identifies and unfollows non-followers.

    -   Add your GitHub token:

        ```

        Replace `YOUR_GITHUB_TOKEN` with your personal access token. You can generate one [here](https://github.com/settings/tokens).  Make sure the token has the `public_repo` or `repo` scope.
